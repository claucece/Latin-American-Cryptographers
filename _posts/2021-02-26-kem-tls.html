      <div class="article-text">
        <p>This article has also been posted to <a href="https://thomwiggers.nl/talk/post-quantum-tls-without-handshake-signatures-at-rwc-2021/">Thom Wiggers’s blog</a>, <a href="https://www.sofiaceli.com/2021/01/10/cf-kemtls.html">Sofía Celi's blog</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/kemtls-post-quantum-tls-without-signatures/">Cloudflare's blog</a>. Re-posted here with permission.</p>
        <p>Fundamentally, the Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS), which secures most
          of the Internet connections, has mainly been a key exchange authenticated by
          digital signatures<sup><a href="#foot1">[1]</a></sup>. Even though it has
          undergone major changes since 1994, when SSL 1.0 was introduced by Netscape,
          it’s main mechanism has remained the same. The key exchange that is used was
          first based on RSA and later on (elliptic curve) Diffie-Hellman. The signatures
          used for authentication have almost always been RSA-based, though in recent
          years other kinds of signatures have been adopted, mainly ECDSA and Ed25519.
          This recent change to elliptic curve cryptography at both at a key exchange and
          signature level has resulted in considerable speed and bandwidth benefits in
          comparison to classic Diffie-Hellman and RSA.</p>
        <p>TLS is the main protocol that protects the connections we use everyday. It is
          everywhere: it is used when we buy products online, when we register for a
          newsletter or when we access any kind of website. But, with the imminent
          threat of <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/securing-the-post-quantum-world/">the arrival of quantum computers</a>
          (a threat that seems to be getting closer and closer), we need to reconsider
          again the future of TLS. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">A wide-scale post-quantum experiment</a>
          was carried out by Cloudflare and Google: two post-quantum key exchanges were
          integrated into Cloudflare’s TLS stack and deployed at their edge servers and in
          Chrome Canary clients. The goal of that experiment was to evaluate the
          performance and feasibility of deployment of two post-quantum key exchanges in
          TLS.</p>
        <p>Similar experiments have been proposed for introducing post-quantum algorithms
          into the TLS handshake itself. Unfortunately it seems infeasible to replace both
          the key exchange and signature with post-quantum primitives as post-quantum
          cryptographic primitives are bigger, or slower (or both) than their predecessors.
          The proposed algorithms under consideration in
          the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions">NIST post-quantum standardization process</a>
          use larger mathematical objects than what is used for elliptic curves,
          traditional Diffie-Hellman or RSA. As a result, the size of public keys,
          signatures and key exchange material is much bigger than those from elliptic
          curves, Diffie-Hellman or RSA.</p>
        <p>How can we solve this problem? How can we use post-quantum algorithms as part
          of the TLS handshake without making the material too big to be transmitted? In
          this blogpost, we will introduce a new mechanism for making this happen, explain
          how it can be integrated into the TLS 1.3 handshake and talk about
          implementation details. The key observation in this mechanism is that, while
          post-quantum algorithms have bigger communication size than their predecessors,
          post-quantum <strong>key exchanges</strong> have somewhat smaller sizes than post-quantum
          <strong>signatures</strong>, so we can try to replace signatures with key exchanges in some
          places to save space. We will only focus on the TLS 1.3 handshake as it is the
          TLS version that should be currently used.
        </p>

        <h2>The past experiments: making the traditional TLS 1.3 handshake post-quantum</h2>

        <p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446">TLS 1.3</a> was introduced in August 2018
          with many security and performance improvements (notably, having only one
          round-trip to complete the handshake). But TLS 1.3 is designed for a world with
          classical computers, and some of its functionalities will be broken by quantum
          computers when they arrive.</p>
        <p>The primary goals of TLS 1.3 are to provide authentication (the server side of
          the channel is always authenticated, the client side is optionally
          authenticated), confidentiality and integrity by using a handshake protocol and
          a record protocol. The handshake protocol, the one of interest for us today,
          establishes the cryptographic parameters for securing and authenticating a
          connection. It can be thought of as of having three main phases, as defined in
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446">RFC8446</a>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>Parameter Negotiation</strong> phase (referred to as ‘Server Parameters’ in
            RFC8446), which establishes some handshake parameters (whether the client is
            authenticated, application-layer protocol support, etc).
          </li>
          <li>The <strong>Key Exchange</strong> phase, which establishes shared keying material and
            selects the cryptographic parameters to be used. Everything after this phase
            will be encrypted.
          </li>
          <li>The <strong>Authentication</strong> phase, which authenticates the server (and, optionally,
            the client) and provides key confirmation and handshake integrity.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The main idea of past experiments that introduced post-quantum algorithms into
          the handshake of TLS 1.3 was to use them in place of classical algorithms by
          advertising them as part of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-4.2.7">supported groups</a>
          (an extension used by the client to indicate which named groups -Elliptic Curve
          Groups, Finite Field Groups- it supports for key exchange)
          and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-4.2.8">key share</a> (an extension
          which contains the endpoint’s cryptographic parameters) extensions, and, therefore,
          establishing with them the negotiated connection parameters. Key encapsulation
          mechanisms (KEMs) are an abstraction of the basic key exchange primitive and
          were used to generate the shared secrets. In the case of using a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-4.2.11">pre-shared key</a>,
          its symmetric algorithms can be easily replaced by post-quantum KEMs, as well;
          and, in the case of password-authenticated TLS, there has been some
          <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1192.pdf">proposed ideas</a> on how to use
          post-quantum algorithms with them.
        </p>

        <p><img src="../images/articles/kem_tls_article_images/tls_with_pq.png" alt="TLS and PQ-KEMs" /></p>

        <p>Most of the above ideas only provide what is often defined as ‘transitional
          security’, as its main focus is providing quantum-resistant confidentiality,
          but do not take into account quantum-resistant authentication. The idea of
          using post-quantum signatures for TLS authentication is possible, but the sizes
          of post-quantum signatures are larger than traditional ones. Furthermore, it is
          worth noting that using <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Presentations/2019/the-2nd-round-of-the-nist-pqc-standardization-proc">post-quantum signatures is much heavier than using post-quantum KEMs</a>.</p>
        <p>We can estimate the impact of such a replacement on network traffic by simply
          looking at the sum of the cryptographic objects that are transmitted during the
          handshake. In a typical TLS 1.3 handshake using elliptic curve X25519 and
          RSA-2048, such a handshake would transmit 1376 bytes corresponding to: the
          public keys for key exchange, the certificate, the signature of the handshake,
          and the certificate chain. If we were to replace X25519 by the post-quantum
          KEM <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/">Kyber512</a> and RSA by the post-quantum
          signature <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/">Dilithium II</a>, two of the more
          efficient proposals, the size of the transmitted data would increase to 10036<sup><a href="#foot2">[2]</a></sup>
          bytes. This increase is mostly due to the size of the post-quantum signature
          algorithm.</p>
        <p>The question then is: how can we achieve full post-quantum security and create a
          handshake that is efficient to be used?</p>

        <h2>A more efficient proposal: KEMTLS</h2>

        <p>There is a long history of other mechanisms, besides signatures, being used for
          authentication. Modern protocols, such as the Signal protocol, the Noise
          framework or WireGuard, rely on key exchange mechanisms for authentication, which
          are somewhat unsuitable for the TLS 1.3 case as they expect the long-term key
          material to be known in advance by the interested parties.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/978.pdf">OPTLS proposal</a> by Krawczyk and Wee
          authenticates the TLS handshake without signatures by using a
          non-interactive key exchange (NIKE). However, the only somewhat efficient
          construction for a post-quantum NIKE is CSIDH, the security of which is the
          subject of ongoing debate. But, we can build on this idea by using KEMs for
          authentication. KEMTLS, the current proposed experiment, replaces the handshake
          signature by a post-quantum KEM key exchange. It was designed and introduced
          by Peter Schwabe, Douglas Stebila and Thom Wiggers in the
          publication <a href="https://thomwiggers.nl/publication/kemtls/kemtls.pdf">‘Post-Quantum TLS Without Handshake Signatures’</a>.</p>
        <p>KEMTLS, therefore, achieves the same goals as TLS 1.3 (authentication,
          confidentiality and integrity) in the face of quantum computers. One small
          difference compared to the TLS 1.3 handshake is that KEMTLS allows the client to
          send encrypted application data since the second client-to-server TLS message
          flow when client authentication is not required, and in the third
          client-to-server TLS message flow when mutual authentication is required. Note
          that with TLS 1.3 the server is able to send encrypted and authenticated
          application data in its first response message (although, in most uses of
          TLS 1.3, this feature is not actually used). With KEMTLS, then, when client
          authentication is not required, the client is able to send its first encrypted
          application data after the same amount of handshake round trips as in TLS 1.3.</p>
        <p>Intuitively, the handshake signature in TLS 1.3 proves possession of the private
          key corresponding to the public key certified in the TLS 1.3 server certificate.
          For these signature schemes, this is the straightforward way to prove
          possession; but it’s also possible to make such proof through key exchanges. By
          carefully considering the key derivation sequence, only the server holding the
          private key that corresponds to the certified public key can decrypt any
          messages sent by the client to the server. Therefore, implicit authentication
          is fulfilled. It is worth noting that KEMTLS still relies on signatures by
          certificate authorities to authenticate the long-term KEM keys.</p>
        <p>As said, KEMTLS’ application data transmitted during the handshake is implicitly,
          rather than explicitly authenticated (as in TLS 1.3), and has slightly weaker
          downgrade resilience and forward secrecy; but full downgrade resilience and
          forward secrecy is achieved once the KEMTLS handshake completes.</p>

        <p>By replacing the handshake signature by a KEM key exchange, we reduce the size
          of the data transmitted in the example handshake using Kyber512 and Dilithium II
          to 8344 bytes, a significant reduction. Even for algorithms, such the
          NTRU-assumption based KEM NTRU and signature algorithm Falcon, that have a
          less-pronounced size gap, we still reduce bytes. KEM operations are typically
          computationally much lighter than signing operations as well, which makes the
          reduction even more significant.</p>

        <p>KEMTLS was presented at ACM CCS 2020. You can read more about its details in
          the <a href="https://thomwiggers.nl/publication/kemtls/kemtls.pdf">paper</a>. It was
          initially implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/thomwiggers/kemtls-experiment">RustTLS library</a> by
          Thom Wiggers using optimized C/assembly implementations of the post-quantum
          algorithms provided by the <a href="https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean">PQClean</a> and
          <a href="https://openquantumsafe.org/">Open Quantum Safe</a> projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Cloudflare and KEMTLS: the implementation</h2>

        <p>As part of our effort to show that TLS can be completely post-quantum safe, we
          implemented the full KEMTLS handshake over the Golang’s TLS 1.3 suite. The
          implementation was done in several steps:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We first needed to clone our own version of Golang, so we could add different
            post-quantum algorithms to it. You can find our own version <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/go/">here</a>.
            This code gets constantly updated with every release of Golang, following <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/go/wiki/Starting-out">these steps</a>.</li>
          <li>We needed to implement post-quantum algorithms in Golang, which we did in our
            own cryptographic library <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/tree/master/kem">CIRCL</a>.</li>
          <li>As we cannot force Certificate Authorities to use certificates with long-term
            post-quantum KEM keys, we decided to use <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/keyless-delegation/">Delegated Credentials</a>.
            A delegated credential is a short-lasting key that the certificate’s owner has
            delegated for use in TLS 1.3. Therefore, they can be used for having
            post-quantum KEM keys. See its implementation in our Golang code <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/go/tree/cf-delegated-credentials">here</a>.</li>
          <li>We implemented mutual auth (client and server authentication) KEMTLS by using
            Delegated Credentials for the authentication process. See its implementation
            in our Golang code <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/go/tree/cf-pq-kemtls">here</a>.
            You can also check this <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/go/blob/cf-pq-kemtls/src/crypto/tls/delegated_credentials_test.go#L774">test</a>
            for an overview of how it works.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><br />
          Implementing KEMTLS was a straightforward process, although it did require
          changes to the way Golang handles a TLS 1.3 handshake and how the key schedule
          works.</p>

        <p>A “regular” TLS 1.3 handshake in Golang (from the server perspective) looks like
          this:</p>

        <p><img src="../images/articles/kem_tls_article_images/golang_tls.png" alt="Implemented Golang TLS 1.3 Handshake" /></p>

        <p>We had to interrupt at the point that the server sends the Certificate
          (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sendServerCertificate()</code>) in order to send the KEMTLS specific messages. In
          the same way, we had to add the appropriate KEM TLS messages to the client’s
          handshake. And, as we did not want to change so much the way Golang handles
          TLS 1.3, we only added one new constant to the configuration that can be used
          by a server in order to ask for the Client’s Certificate (the constant
          is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">serverConfig.ClientAuth = RequestClientKEMCert</code>).</p>

        <p>The implementation is easy to work with: if a delegated credential or a
          certificate has a public key of a supported post-quantum KEM algorithms, the
          handshake will proceed with KEMTLS. If the server requests for a Client KEMTLS
          Certificate, the handshake will use client KEMTLS authentication.</p>

        <h2>Running the Experiment</h2>

        <p>So, what is next? What is next is to take the code we have produced and run it
          in the actual Cloudflare infrastructure to measure how efficiently it works.</p>
